Description
This code implements a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game allows players to alternately place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. It includes functionalities for initializing the game board, displaying the board state, making moves, switching turns, checking for a winner, and determining a draw. 

Functions
1. InitializeBoard
Purpose: Initializes the 3x3 board by setting all positions to empty (EMPTY, represented as ' ').
2. DisplayBoard
Purpose: Displays the current state of the game board in a formatted 3x3 grid with visual separators (| for columns and --+--+-- for rows).
3. Player_Switch
Purpose: Switches the current player between 'X' and 'O'.
4. CheckWinningMoves
Purpose: Checks if the current player has met one of the winning conditions (3 in a row, column, or diagonal).
5. CheckDraw
Purpose: Determines if the game is a draw by checking if all cells are filled without any player meeting the winning condition.
6. PlayGame
Purpose: Implements the main game loop where players alternately make moves until the game ends with a win or a draw.
